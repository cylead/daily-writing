#### Affine
1. The equivalency of two definitions of affine
2. The subspace associated with an affine set is a subspace
3. The solution set to a linear equation system is an affine set. The associated subspace is its null space.
4. Any affine set can be expressed as the solution set to a linear equation system.
   1. construct the associated subspace, which is also a subspace of R^n, find the orthogonal complement space in R^n, find the basis vector and construct A, Ax = 0, A(x+x_0) = Ax_0
   2. I checked this with the [solution](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/2812843/every-affine-set-can-be-expressed-as-the-solution-set-of-a-system-of-linear-equa) online 

#### cone 
analogy: collection of rays that starts at the origin 

#### special case of convex set
1. Euclidean ball is a convex set.
2. Simplex is a type of polydedron
   1. proof: p33
### positive semidefinite
1. How to judge the positive semidefiniteness?
   1. eigenvalue
   2. leading principal minors are all nonnegative
