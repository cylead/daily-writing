## Part I Fundamentals


## Part III Conditioning and Stability

### lecture 12
absolute or relative?

difference in conditioning and stability? operational-wise?

eg 12.3?

Feynman Lucky numbers?

Polynomial root finding ill-condition?

superimposed roots?

$$\kappa = \|A\|\frac{\|x\|}{\|Ax\|} \leq \|A\|\|A^+\|$$
When are they equal?
when $x$ is multiple of the singular vector corresponding to the minmimum singular value.

Fact: $\|A\|_2 = \sigma_{max}, \|A^+\|_2 = \frac{1}{\sigma_{min}}$

foundemental things: theorem 12.1 and 12.2
The conclusion in the last paragraph!

### lecture 13
The 2x-1 problem?

determinant overflow?
