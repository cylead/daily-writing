### What is reproducing kernel Hilbert Space?
A Hilbert space is a vector space where the inner product is properly defined.
RKHS is a type of Hilbert space of functions.
Definition of Dirac evaluation functional (point evaluation)
### What is not RKHS?
eg29 (iii) confusing

### what are the properties of RKHS?
The reproducing property, also its extension
Positive definite:

### How is it related to kernel?
A function is said to be a kernel if there exists a real Hilberspace and a map $\phi$ s.t.
$$k(x, y) = <\phi(x), \phi(y)>_{\mathbf{H}}$$
(the kernal can be expressed as inner products in a certain Hilbert space.)

### Why is it important?
