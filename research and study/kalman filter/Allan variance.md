I think you have great ideas on how to help students better retain the information. Asking the right questions, breaking the tasks to be smaller pieces and putting more time into preparation would all help. I suggest that you can also include some tips from neuroscience and psychology. For example, asking (or letting) the students perform deliberate practice and active recall and self-tests in class or out of school could also help with memorizing information.

Your goal is to motivate students to learn naturally. To achieve this, you mentioned improving communication among students, TA and examiners, sharing personal experiences and using utilitarian goals to motivate students. I think they would help psychologically. I think in terms of teaching content you can also help students face difficulties with more confidence and become motivated. You can try to analyze what kinds of difficulties students would face that make them frustrated. Then certain strategies could be applied to reduce the difficulties, for example, breaking one task into smaller pieces and repeated training on complex tasks.
