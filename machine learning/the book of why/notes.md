Introduction: mind over data

Problems: "preventing", "cause", "attribute to", "policy", "should I" ...

-> "new science", causal inference

Why wasn't this done a long time ago?
1. The mathematical structure does not show causality. $B=kP$
2. Human brains are good at handling causations so there wes not enough need to mathematically do that.
3. Historical reasons, a subject needs incentives. - Sewall Wright did some work in 1920s, but underappreciated.

"Causal revolution"

What is it:
Causal digram and symbolic language (resembling algebra)

details:
do operator $P(L \mid do(D))$, $P(L \mid do(not-D))$, different with $P(L \mid D)$

prediction: predict the effects of an intervention withou4 actually enacting it
